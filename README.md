# Regarding this template:

## Problem

Unity doesn't show `~` (tilde) folders, so you can't get there in the Editor.

## Solution

You need a local folder that is visible inside Unity, and not tracked by git.
You can do this by [symlinking](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/symlink-support) from your `Samples~` folder to another folder without the `~` in the name. This template is setup to work with a folder called `InEditorSamples`, and below is how you simultaneously create and symlink to it. 

```bash
cd /ToFolder/OfPackage/

ln -s Samples~ InEditorSamples # Will create a symlinked folder called InEditorSamples
```

In a `.gitignore` track the folder and it's `.meta` so they donâ€™t get added to the repo:

```bash 
InEditorSamples
InEditorSamples.meta
```
